🏠 Kijiji Rental Market Prediction Project 🏠



🎨 Project Overview

The Kijiji Rental Market Prediction Project aims to analyze and predict rental prices for properties listed on Kijiji. By using features like location, property type, number of bedrooms, and amenities, this project builds a machine learning model to estimate rental prices. This project highlights the role of data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling in the real estate domain.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of rental listings scraped from Kijiji. It includes information on property details, location, and pricing. Key features in the dataset include:

🏠 Property Title
📍 Location (City, Province, etc.)
🛏️ Bedrooms
🛁 Bathrooms
📏 Square Footage
💲 Price (Rental price - Target variable)
📆 Date Posted
📜 Description (Textual details about the property)
🏗️ Property Type (Apartment, House, Condo, etc.)

🌐 Project Objectives
🔄 Data Exploration & Visualization: Understand trends and patterns in rental prices.
🔧 Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numeric features.
🔺 Feature Engineering: Extract new features from existing data, such as property age or sentiment analysis on descriptions.
💡 Model Development: Build machine learning models to predict rental prices.
📊 Model Evaluation: Use R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as evaluation metrics.

🔁 Project Workflow
📖 Data Collection: Import Kijiji rental listings data.
📁 Data Cleaning: Handle missing data for features like Square Footage, Bedrooms, and Bathrooms.
💡 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize distributions, check correlations, and understand feature importance.
🎨 Feature Engineering: Create new features, such as extracting amenities from descriptions and calculating price per square foot.
🤖 Model Selection & Training: Train models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regressors.
🔍 Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search.
📊 Prediction & Insights: Use the trained model to predict rental prices for new properties.

🧰 Technologies Used
💻 Programming Language: Python
📊 Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
💡 Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Regressor
📊 Model Evaluation: R-squared, MAE, RMSE
