1. Project Overview

The Kijiji dataset project focuses on analyzing rental market data from small communities. The aim is to gain insights into rental price trends, availability, and other key market indicators. This analysis can support decision-making for renters, property owners, and policymakers interested in understanding local housing market dynamics.

2. Dataset Description

The Kijiji dataset contains rental listings from small communities, with features that capture essential information about rental properties.

Key Features:

Location: The community or neighborhood where the rental is located.

Property Type: Type of rental property (e.g., apartment, house, condo, etc.).

Price: The monthly rental cost of the property.

Number of Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the rental unit.

Number of Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the rental unit.

Square Footage: Size of the property in square feet (if available).

Date Listed: Date the rental was posted on Kijiji.

Furnished: Indicates whether the property is furnished or unfurnished.

Pet Friendly: Indicates if pets are allowed in the property.

3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

To ensure data quality and reliability, the following preprocessing steps were performed:

Handling Missing Data: Missing values for key features like price, location, and number of bedrooms were addressed using imputation techniques or removal of incomplete records.

Data Type Conversion: Data types were converted appropriately for features like price (float) and date listed (datetime).

Outlier Detection: Unusual or extreme rental prices were identified and either flagged or removed to prevent skewing of analysis.

Normalization and Encoding: Text-based columns, such as 'Furnished' and 'Pet Friendly,' were encoded into binary variables (0 or 1) for easier analysis.

Date Formatting: The 'Date Listed' column was formatted to a standard date format to facilitate trend analysis.

4. Analysis & Objectives

The main objectives of the Kijiji dataset analysis are as follows:

Price Analysis: Understand how rental prices vary across small communities.

Market Trends: Identify trends in rental availability over time.

Demand Analysis: Investigate the impact of property features (bedrooms, bathrooms, pet-friendly status) on rental demand.

Community Comparison: Compare rental prices across different small communities to identify high-demand areas.

Tools & Techniques Used:

Data Visualization: Used libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize rental trends.

Statistical Analysis: Performed hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to identify patterns in the data.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented regression models to predict rental prices based on property features.

5. Key Insights

Price Variations: Rental prices vary significantly between small communities. Certain communities exhibit higher prices due to proximity to key amenities.

Influence of Property Features: Features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and pet-friendliness have a direct impact on rental prices.

Seasonal Trends: The number of available rentals fluctuates seasonally, with higher availability in certain months.

6. Challenges & Limitations

Data Completeness: Some records were incomplete, requiring imputation or removal, which may impact the representativeness of the data.

Community Size: Small communities often have limited data points, which can affect the robustness of machine learning models.

Data Freshness: Rental markets change frequently, so data may not reflect the most up-to-date conditions.

7. Usage & Applications

Rental Market Analysis: Helps tenants understand the cost of living in small communities.

Property Investment Decisions: Supports investors and property managers in identifying profitable rental locations.

Policy Making: Assists local government in understanding housing demand and rental affordability.

8. How to Use This Dataset

Data Loading: Load the Kijiji dataset into a DataFrame using Python libraries such as Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use data visualization and summary statistics to explore patterns and insights.

Feature Engineering: Prepare the data for machine learning models by encoding categorical features and normalizing numerical features.

Model Training: Train regression models to predict rental prices or classification models to determine rental demand.

9. Files Included

kijiji_dataset.csv: The raw dataset containing all rental property records.

cleaned_dataset.csv: The processed version of the dataset used for analysis and modeling.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks containing EDA, preprocessing, and machine learning models.

visualizations/: Plots and charts generated during analysis.
